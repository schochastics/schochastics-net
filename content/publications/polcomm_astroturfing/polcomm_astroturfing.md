abstract : "Political  astroturfing,  a  centrally  coordinated  disinformation  campaign  in  which participants pretend to be ordinary citizens acting independently, has the potential to influence electoral outcomes and other forms of political behavior. Yet, it is hard to evaluate the scope and effectiveness of political astroturfing without “ground truth”information, such as the verified identity of its agents and instigators. In this paper, we  study  the  South  Korean  National  Information  Service’s  (NIS)  disinformation campaign  during  the  presidential  election  in  2012,  taking  advantage  of  a  list  of campaign  accounts  published  in  court  proceedings.  Features  that  best  distinguish these  accounts  from  regular  users  in  contemporaneously  collected  Twitter  data are traces left by coordination among astroturfing agents, instead of the individual account  characteristics  typically  used  in  related  approaches  such  as  social  bot detection. We develop a methodology that exploits these distinct empirical patterns to identify additional likely astroturfing accounts and validate this detection strategy by analyzing their messages and current account status. However, an analysis relying on Twitter influence metrics shows that the known and suspect NIS accounts only had a limited impact on political social media discussions. By using the principal-agent framework to analyze one of the earliest revealed instances of political astroturfing, we improve on extant methodological approaches to detect disinformation campaigns and ground them more firmly in social science theory."
